Literature Survey 

Background

Stock price prediction remains a critical challenge in financial markets where investors aim to forecast future price movements to minimize risk and maximize returns. Traditional approaches such as fundamental analysis (evaluating company financials) and technical analysis (chart patterns, indicators) often fail to capture the complexity and volatility of real-world market data.

In recent years, Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) have emerged as powerful tools to model these complex, non-linear relationships. Among DL models, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and their variants—Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks—are particularly well-suited to time-series forecasting because they capture temporal dependencies in sequential data.

GRU models are computationally more efficient than LSTMs while providing comparable predictive accuracy, making them ideal for stock market forecasting where training speed and real-time performance are important.

Goal

The primary objective is to reduce investor risk, support decision-making, and enable algorithmic trading strategies by accurately predicting stock prices using historical price data and technical indicators.

Limitations of Existing Systems
Data Quality & Noise: Stock prices are influenced by random events and market sentiment, making data inherently noisy.

Overfitting: Many deep learning models perform well in backtesting but fail in live trading due to market regime shifts.

Limited Feature Set: Most studies rely solely on OHLCV data, ignoring news, macroeconomic events, and alternative data.

Real-Time Limitations: Many models are trained offline, lacking real-time deployment capabilities.

Lack of Interpretability: GRU/LSTM models function as "black boxes," making their predictions difficult to explain to traders.

Market Efficiency: The Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) suggests that perfectly predicting stock prices in the long run may be fundamentally impossible.
